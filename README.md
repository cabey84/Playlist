# Playlist-
Playlist teaches proper MVC design through creating Playlist and Song objects with corresponding controllers, and teaches the singleton pattern.

Takeaways: 
    -  In the Model Controller, add a singleton to access an instance of the model controller from anywhere, add an array to store data and Create/Read/Update/Delete (CRUD) functions here
    - Use singleton.array in the model controller to populate the table view in the view controller 
    - NOTE: some issues converting to swift 3 because of changes in syntax to tableview data source functions. Issue has been fixed.
